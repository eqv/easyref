## EasyRefence
EasyReference is a simple, open source, statically hosted webapp that allows artists to very quickly compare their drawing against a reference by overlaying a picture on your phones camera feed. 

To try it, simply open: https://eqv.github.io/easyref on your phone/table. 

Note: Currently broken on safari/apple devices, patches welcome.

* Mirroring: Mirror the reference picture and the video stream to see your image with fresh eyes.
* Blinking: quickly toggle between showing the reference and the video stream to visually amplify differences
